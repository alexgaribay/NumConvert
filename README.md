NumConvert
==========

Simple Android app that converts numbers between base number types.

This is an app I made in college and is free to use wherever.

### NOTE

I am in the process of rewriting the app so some of my code is way out of date. NumConvert.java was my first attempt at the app is very bad design. It is being rewritten to follow an MVC pattern.
